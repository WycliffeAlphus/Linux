To see the history of all the past commands use:

```bash
history
```

And to run the immediate previous command use:

```bash
!!
```

```bash
clear
```
Clear is used to cleanup the terminal display.

Using ```ctrl-R``` starts a reverse search thus by starting to type a command one will be given matching list to choose from.

The tab also helps to autocomplete the commands based on what is in the working directory.
