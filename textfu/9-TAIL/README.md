### tail

The tail command helps one to see the last `10` lines:

```bash
tail README.md
```

One can also specify the number:

```bash
tail -n 15 README.md
```

The `-f` (follow) option helps one to see the changes that are being made as new lines are added to a file.

```bash
tail -f README.md
```
