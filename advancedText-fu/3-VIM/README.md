# Search Patterns

To search for a word use `/keyword` : It does a forward search

However to do a backward search use `?/keyword`


# VIM Navigation

To navigate a test document in vime use:

`h or the left arrow key` to move to the left

`k or up arrow key` moves one up

`j or the down key` moves one down one line.

`l or the right arrow` move one to the right by one character.

# Vim apppending text

To insert text before the cursor use : `i`

On a previous line use `O`

Insert test on the next line use: `o`

`a` appends text after the cursor

`A` - append text at the end of the line

# Vim Editing

`x` - used to cut the selected text also used for deleting characters

`dd` - used to delete the current line

`y` - yank or copy what is selected

`yy` yank or copy the current line

`p`- paste the copied text before the cursor

# Vim Saving and Exiting

`:q!` - quit out of wim without saving th file

`ZZ` - equivalent of `:wq` but faster by one character
